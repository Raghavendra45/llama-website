    			<p class="para">
    				A robot with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of doing every strategically 
    				relevant task as well as a human, but that continues to retain all the advantages of a 
    				computer, would have many advantages when competing with humans for control. A computer 
    				program, unlike a human, has the ability to quickly reproduce itself, to upgrade itself 
    				onto better hardware as it becomes available, and might have the capacity for perfect 
    				recall of a vast knowledge base. 
    			</p>
    			<h3 class="h3Class"> The AI threat </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				AI takeover refers to a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) 
    				becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computers or robots effectively 
    				taking control of the planet away from the human race. Possible scenarios include a 
    				takeover by a superintelligent AI and the popular notion of a robot uprising. 
    			</p>
    		</div>
    		
    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Conflict Inevitable </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				For an AI takeover to be inevitable, it has to be postulated that two intelligent species cannot 
    				pursue mutually the goals of coexisting peacefully in an overlapping environmentâ€”especially if one 
    				is of much more advanced intelligence and much more powerful. While an AI takeover is thus a possible 
    				result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible.
