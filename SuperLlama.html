    				Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some 
    				sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. They are used most commonly 
    				in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral 
    				dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single male Llama is used as a guard. Using llamas as guards 
    				has reduced the losses to predators for many producers.

    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Super Llama </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				Some Llamas go beyond than only being a livestock guard, one such Llama is known as the "Super
    				Llama". A livestock guard during the day and the guardian of the Earth during the night, Super 
    				Llama is a silent vigilante protecting the Earth and its inhabitants from the forces of evil.
    				The capabilities of Super Llama include the ability to fly, fire laser beams from its eyes, 
    				x-ray vision, super strength and speed. As there is a high plausibility of evil Robots revolting 
    				against the inhabitants of Earth in order to take control of the Earth, the need for a protector 
					like Super Llama is inevitable.

    				Super Llama usually wears a blue costume with a red and yellow emblem on the chest, consisting 
    				of the letter S in a shield shape, and a red cape. Sometimes Super Llama can also be seen with 
    				only the red cape.
