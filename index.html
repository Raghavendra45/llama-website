    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Llama Origin </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America 
    				about 40 million years ago. They migrated to South America about three million 
    				years ago. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids 
    				were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas 
    				and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 
    				20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States
    				 and Canada.

    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Llama Characteristics </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 m (5.6 to 5.9 ft) tall at the 
    				top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg (290 and 440 lb). At birth, a baby 
    				llama (called a cria) can weigh between 9 and 14 kg (20 and 31 lb). Llamas typically live 
    				for 15 to 25 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more. A llama is fully grown
    				at 4 years old and often live in social groups called herds.
