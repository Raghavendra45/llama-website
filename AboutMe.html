    			<p class="para">
    				I am currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science specializing in Computing Systems at 
    				Georgia Institute of Technology. And prior to starting my graduate studies I was working for four 
    				years in the Software industry. Although my work experience was related to Computing Systems, I had
    				done few web development projects as well.  
    			</p>
    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Why Front End Development ? </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				During my undergraduate studies I had taken a course on web development and was very much fascinated 
    				with the simplicity involved in providing a rich user experience for the billions of web users. 
    				Naturally I chose to do my UG project related to Web development and developed a mobile web 
    				application for making online purchases. Front end is the interface through which billions of 
    				users interact with the complex inter connected network, the web. The more simpler and feature rich 
    				the front end, the more people would like to visit the site repeatedly. Thus front end developers 
    				woud get more opportunities to use their creatvity and innovate with every page they develop in order
    				to attract more people to visit their sites.      
    			</p>
    		</div>
    		
    			<h3 class="h3Class"> Why I built the site this way ? </h3>
    			<p class="para">
    				Front end is all about being creative and using the latest web technologies to create beautiful
    				web pages. Llamas are furry and cute. The current CEO of Zappos is fond of llamas and has two of 
    				them as his pets. As this site is developed for getting an internship at Zappos, the site should be
    				reflective of the interests of Zappos's senior most executive. I am a fun loving person thus I 
    				created the web page with the concept of Super Llama as being the savior who would fight against
    				evil robots.
